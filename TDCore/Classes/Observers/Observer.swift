 Definition of an object for adding KVO and `NSNotificationCenter` obeservations to pure Swift classes.
 
 `NSObject`s implement a method called `methodSignatureForSelector:` which converts from strings to methods. Pure Swift classes do not have this method so cannot inherently perform KVO or observe `NSNotificationCenter` posts. Rather than making a Swift class inherit from `NSObject`, which introuduces unnecessary features, an `Observer` can be retained which performs an arbitrary block on copmletion.
 
 Two default implementations are provided, `NotificationObserver` and `ObjectObserver` for `NSNotificationCenter` observing and keypath observing respectively.
